The first screen displayed is the intro screen. Press any key on the keyboard to move to the next screen.

The second screen is instructions on how the program operates. Again, press any key to move on to the next screen.
NOTE: The 'seed' value for the random generator is the value from the entered key, so it is more fun to alternate they keys you use to move the screen on. 

The last screen depicts first: the guess number that you are on (you are allowed 12 guesses.) Following that are your color guess for the 4 available positions. Following those guesses are the games calculation of how accurate the guess was. A '+' indicates a pin of the correct color in the correct position. A '-' indicates a pin of the correct color in an incorrect position. 

If the correct code is guessed, a 'You win' line will be displayed.

After 12 guesses have passed, a note will appear indicating that the 'game' won, and will also display the correct code.
