 Game Logic:
 We have 8 pairs (16 total cards)
 We can have a counter for the number of pairs.
 Start counter=0
 while (counter < 8) 
  press first square
  flip the square to reveal card (flip_up)
  press second square
  flip the square to reveal card (flip_up)
    if the cards are not equal to each other
      flip them back over (make black squares) (flip_down)
    if the cards are equal to each other
      increment counter
      remove the cards (make the spot white) (remove)
  if counter==8
    then inform the user that they won

 The Cards:
  can we upload images into Jack? 
    either make them in paint or something
    or find images online 
  we can make a private int of each card object
    number each card 0-7, so there will be duplicates
  flip_up:
    set the image to show up
  flip_down: 
    set the card to be a black square
  remove:
    set the card to be a white square

 Gui: we need to display 4x4 grid of cards
 need to implement mouseClickers
